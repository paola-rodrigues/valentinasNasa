# Valentina - On the way to the sun.

This project was developed with the objective of solving the problem 'A Caminho do Sol' made available for the NASA Hackathon in 2022. The Valentinas team (as registered on the event's website) developed the solution in the form of a game in order to build the knowledge.

The game Valentinas - On the way to the sun that tells the story of the trajectory of a probe that "touched" the Sun, the Parker Solar Probe. We solved the challenge by bringing the story to the user in a playful and gamified way. Where he will need to complete the given quests to unlock more information about the story.
